# JULEP
This software package contains Matlab scripts to reproduce results for Multi-band Multi-shot Diffusion MRI Reconstruction with Joint Usage of Structured Low-rank Constraints and Explicit Phase Mapping (JULEP).
## Getting Started
Run JULEP_main.m to reproduce the resutls of JULEP.

Example data of MB=3, Nshot=4 are provided in data folder. Also refer to the example data for data format requirement.
